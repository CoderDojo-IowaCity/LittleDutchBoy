## Welcome to the Little Dutch Boy game

### HTML5 game made with Construct 2 for the [Ideum table](http://ideum.com/products/multitouch/platform/)

If you're a ninja (student) of our dojo, you need to first 'fork' this project to your account.  Then you can use the app [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) to download your 'forked' copy.  If you're using either app, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new repo.

***

If you are a git master (see [http://gitimmersion.com](http://gitimmersion.com)) and prefer the terminal, then make sure you add the CoderDojo repository as a remote:
```
$ cd your_repo_root/LittleDutchBoy
$ git remote set-url --add coderdojo https://github.com/CoderDojo-IowaCity/LittleDutchBoy.git
$ git fetch all
```
If you want to grab the CoderDojo Iowa City changes (moves your changes to the end of the tree):
``` 
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase coderdojo/master
$ git push origin master:master
```
If the second command comes back with an error, then you and the 'coderdojo' repo have changed the same line(s) in a file.
