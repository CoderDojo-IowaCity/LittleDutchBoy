Then you can use the app [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) to download your 'forked' copy.  If you're using either app, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new repo.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIf you are a git master (see [http://gitimmersion.com](http://gitimmersion.com)) and prefer the terminal, then make sure you add the CoderDojo repository as a remote:\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/LittleDutchBoy\r\n$ git remote set-url --add coderdojo https://github.com/CoderDojo-IowaCity/LittleDutchBoy.git\r\n$ git fetch all\r\n```\r\nIf you want to grab the CoderDojo Iowa City changes (moves your changes to the end of the tree):\r\n``` \r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git rebase coderdojo/master\r\n$ git push origin master:master\r\n```\r\nIf the second command comes back with an error, then you and the 'coderdojo' repo have changed the same line(s) in a file. \r\n \r\n***\r\n\r\n# Getting help\r\n\r\nUse Google, Github Help pages, or the CoderDojo Iowa City message board to figure out how to fix it.  Mentors are always available via the message board to help you one-on-one.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Ninjas\r\nGet the badges for Git!
